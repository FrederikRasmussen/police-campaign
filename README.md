# Tactical Police Operations (TL8)

Players in this campaign control characters that are part of a SWAT team
operating in the US. Characters can be from SWAT itself or other organisations,
participating as part of training and exchange programmes.

General gameplay will involve tactical operations as a primary theme, with
custom rules for more cinematic medical supplies that can be used during
operations. Training operations and shooting exercises may be part of some
friendly competition with and against other SWAT teams.

Non-operational skills and advantages can be used between sessions
in a less moment-to-monent manner in order to haggle for better equipment, pay,
support in future operations, rank, or other organisational change and support.
Mostly, this is not intended to become a primary focus.

### Medical Supplies

This section contains information on the custom medical supplies added to this
campaign. They are intended to keep the action going, and allow field-repair of
wounded operators without significant time cost.

#### Morphine Autoinjector

Roll Soldier to administer the correct dosage in the correct location.

Duration to apply: 2 to 3 Ready manoeuvres. 1 to retrieve autoinjector, 1 to
apply to suitable exposed skin or thin clothing. 1 extra if target is wearing
particularly difficult gear, such as E.O.D. outfits.

| Result           | Effect                                                                                                                |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical Success | As Success                                                                                                            |
| Success          | Ignore reeling penalties, gain the benefits of High Pain Threshold, and halve the penalty of Stun and Flash grenades. |
| Failure          | Underdose. Ignore Reeling penalties and halve the shock from any injury.                                              |
| Critical Failure | Overdose. As Success, but the recipient is also Numb and has to pass a HT-8 roll to remain conscious.                 |

Regardless of dosage, the effects last for one hour, and gives Laziness for
non-life threatening scenarios such as post-op cleanup.

#### Epinephrine Autoinjector

No roll required. Constant dose.

Duration to apply: 2 to 3 Ready manoeuvres. 1 to retrieve autoinjector, 1 to
apply to suitable exposed skin or thin clothing. 1 extra if target is wearing
particularly difficult gear, such as E.O.D. outfits.

Immediately restore 1d FP, gain Hard to Subdue 5, suffer Overconfidence (12),
and if you are unconscious, attempt a HT check to recover consciousness, at
whatever penalty made you unconscious in the first place.

Receiving multiple doses within 24 hours requires you to pass a HT check or lose
HP equal to your normal maximum. This HT check is modified by Hard to Kill and
at a cumulative -1 per dose beyond 2.

Epinephrine lasts 1 hour.

Once the effects wear off, you suffer from Bad Temper (12) and Chronic
Depression (9) for 1 hour. These effects will likely be present during
debriefing.

#### Bandage

Used to stabilise wound. Rules as Basic Set and High-Tech. Will type up here for
ease-of-use.

#### Immobilising Aluminium Splint

Requires Soldier+2 roll and Adhesive or Rope to apply and fasten.

Duration to apply splint: 2 Ready manoeuvres. 1 to retrieve splint, 1 to fasten
to crippled location.

Duration to fasten splint with adhesive: 3 Ready manoeuvres. 1 to retrieve
adhesive, 2 to apply adhesive.

Duration to fasten splint with rope: 6 Ready manoeuvres. 1 to retrieve rope, 5
to tie rope securely.

Falls off if limb moves significantly without splint being fastened.

| Result           | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Critical Success | If applied to arm or leg, suffer no penalties. After 1 hour or if applied to other limb, act as Success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Success          | Usage of limb is at -2 shock penalty. Reduced as usual by High Pain Threshold or Morphine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Failure          | Usage of limb is at -4 shock penalty. Reduce as usual by High Pain Threshold or Morphine. If wound was stabilised, usage destabilises wound, losing any HP recovered this way as Injury, potentially triggering unconsciousness or death rolls. If wound is not stabilised, usage causes internal damage, preventing further stabilisation. |
| Critical Failure | No effect except preventing stabilisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Regardless of result, the splint prevents stabilising a wound that is not
already stable. Any result above critical failure lets you ignore the effects of
the crippling wound. Using the limb while the wound is not stabilised causes 1
HP of injury, further impacting your shock penalty - total shock still cannot
exceed -4 this way.

**Note:** You may emulate the effects of a Failure splint by using Extra Effort
and paying 1 FP.
