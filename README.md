# Tactical Police Operations (TL8)

Players in this campaign control characters that are part of a SWAT team
operating in the US. Characters can be from SWAT itself or other organisations,
participating as part of training and exchange programmes.

General gameplay will involve tactical operations as a primary theme, with
custom rules for more cinematic medical supplies that can be used during
operations. Training operations and shooting exercises may be part of some
friendly competition with and against other SWAT teams.

Non-operational skills and advantages can be used between sessions
in a less moment-to-monent manner in order to haggle for better equipment, pay,
support in future operations, rank, or other organisational change and support.
Mostly, this is not intended to become a primary focus.
